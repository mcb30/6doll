IPv6 Device On Legacy Link
==========================

The IPv6 Device On Legacy Link (`6doll`) is a small device that can be
attached to almost any home router to provide last-resort IPv6
connectivity.  It is designed for use with ISPs such as [Virgin
Media][virginmedia] that have consistently failed to provide IPv6
despite years of promises.

The `6doll` kit comprises:

* 1x [GL.iNet Microuter N300][n300] mini travel router
* 1x [USB power supply][power]
* 1x Micro USB power cable
* 1x 15cm Ethernet cable

Quick start guide
=================

1. Connect the Microuter N300 to an internal port (typically labelled
   `LAN` or `Ethernet`) on your home router.
2. Connect the Microuter N300 to the USB power supply and wait for
   around 30 seconds.
3. You should now be able to access IPv6-only sites such as
   https://ipv6.google.com from any machine on your home network.
